# AoC_2022
In addition to the fun and satisfaction of solving a puzzle, I am using this year's AoC to 
- learn new concepts and 
- polish my coding skills

#### Some concepts and languages I've practiced so far:

**Python**
- lists (days 1, 3, 5, 10)
- dictionaries (day 7)
- NumPy arrays (day 8)
- concise code (all days, actually, but days 3, 6 and 9 in particular)

**SQL** 
- (days 2 and 4)
